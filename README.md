# Neural Networks
Solving Industry based and Solution based problems through Neural Networks



# 1. Neural Nets as Regressor
DOMAIN : Electronics and Telecommunication

# CONTEXT 
Communications equipment manufacturing companies have products which are responsible for emitting informative signals. We will build a machine learning model which can help the companies to predict the equipment’s signal quality using various parameters.

• **Data Description**: The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:

    1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
    2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality.

• **Objective**: Build a regressor which can use these parameters to determine the signal strength or quality [as number].

• **Steps and tasks:**

1. Import data.
2. Data analysis & visualisation
   • Performing relevant and detailed statistical analysis on the data.
   • Performing relevant and detailed uni, bi and multi variate analysis.
3. Designing, training, tuning and testing a neural network regressor.
4. Pickling the model for future use.
